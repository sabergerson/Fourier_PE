# Fourier_PE
Algorithm for trainable Fourier feature positional encodings for multidimensional data

Based on the Algorithm 1 from the paper: Learnable Fourier Features for Multi-Dimensional Spatial Positional Encoding (Li et al., 2021; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02795.pdf)
Based on the original implementation by willGuimont (https://github.com/willGuimont/learnable_fourier_positional_encoding)
